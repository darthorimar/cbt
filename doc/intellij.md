To refresh o project you need to enable a `CBT tool panel`: just press `ctrl-shift-A` and then enter `cbt`:

When done a tool panel will aperas at the right side: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16403337/27643788-b4d8998c-5c2a-11e7-929e-4e80724d4b6d.png)

#### Creating extra modules
For now IDEA assumes that all modules which you use are in dependencies(may be transitive) of a root module

If you want to work on some module which is not you can right-click on the directory in the project tree view and then choose `Consider as CBT module` (directory should contains `build` directory with a correct build file)

#### Correct build files
For now plugin assumes that if you import some project(or may be just refresh it) all build files do not contain errors. Otherwise it would not just be imported/refreshed
